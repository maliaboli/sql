**Text-to-SQL AI System**

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project is an AI-powered Text-to-SQL system that translates natural language questions into SQL queries and retrieves information from a SQLite database. The AI model also generates human-readable responses from the query results.

**âœ¨ Key Features**

AI-driven SQL Query Generation: Converts natural language into optimized SQL queries.

Multiple Table Support: Retrieves relevant data from different database tables.

Human-like Responses: Transforms SQL query results into natural language answers.

Streamlit Interface: Provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

Efficient Data Handling: Prevents redundant data retrieval.

**ðŸš€ How It Works**

User Input: The user enters a natural language question.

Query Generation: The AI model converts the question into an SQL query.

Database Execution: The SQL query is executed on the SQLite database.

Response Formatting: The AI generates a human-like response based on the query result.

Output Display: The SQL query, raw result, and formatted response are displayed in the Streamlit app.
